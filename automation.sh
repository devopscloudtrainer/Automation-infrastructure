Why Git? 
=============================================================================================================================
* What is VCS? Version control system?
--------------------------------------------------
VCS - Version control system is an mechanism which provides an unique identification for managing the data inside the files via commit_id which is an hexa decimal code  in the form of 125/256 bytes using algorithm called "SHA key" - Secure hashing algorithm.

eg: commit_id - nxni9bd200dh2idhihdnhnbd21dn21

   Every changes will be recorded via commit_id to track the changes and avoid duplication of the data.
------------------------------------------------------
* Why VCS?
------------------------------------------------------
1. Tracking: Who/When/What modified - Proper tracking.
              * Every modification - capture(email and username)
              * Proper date and time - timestamp
              * What modified - added/deleted/modified - each and evert line/word/sentence/files/directories.

2. Storage cost optimization: Avoid the duplication of the data via VCS mechanism
